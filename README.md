WebGL implementation of Tyrian (video game)
------------------------------------------

It's at early stage of development now.

What's ready:
0. Basic menu scenes and scene manager implementation.
1. Content loading of original game.
2. A couple of shader to apply palettes and outlining.

The plan is:
1. Add World with basic game logic.
2. Event system.
3. Mission scene and first playable demo.
4. Replace original graphics with [remastered by LostGarden's Daniel Cook](https://opengameart.org/content/remastered-tyrian-graphics-0).

..... and so on.

Tons of respect to [opentyrian](https://github.com/opentyrian/opentyrian) contributors.
